### Get to know us!

#### Who are we?

We are two friends from Seattle, WA! 

###### Will Hodge 
is a junior at Tuft's University studying biopsychology and computer science. His passions include mental health, David's Tea, EDM trash, the ocean, and his dog Hannah. 

###### Alice Tan
is a junior at Pomona College studying computer science and economics. She enjoys rom coms, hand massages, cooking, hosting dinner parties, and sharing music with Willie.  

#### What's this blog for? 

We have the strangest conversations, the two of us. One second we're talking about our love for Porter Robinson, the next we're talking about making an app using Spotify's API (if you know how to work that, DM us- we sooo lost). Honestly, they're so random and full of energy- the kind that requires three different social media platforms to communicate our disoriented thoughts. Besides new music, food, stupid memes, and 'wholesome' content, there is something else we love sharing with each other: technology and how it relates to us as common consumers. The idea of a blog was born- to converse about this and share our thoughts with maybe 3, 4 if we're lucky, viewers. But we like other stuff too. Simply put, we just want to write stuff and it's a way for us to connect more and share not only with the community (of 3) but with each other. Because long distance friendship is hard and when we fight, we can look at our baby (this blog) and make up.
